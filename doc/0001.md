They are layers in a pattern called **Layered Architecture** (also known as N-Tier Architecture):

```md
Request
   ↓
Controller     → handles HTTP (req, res), validates input
   ↓
Service        → handles business logic (rules, decisions)
   ↓
Repository     → handles database operations
   ↓
Database
```

**Each layer has one job:**

**Controller** (`auth.controller.ts`)
- Receives the HTTP request
- Extracts data from `req.body`
- Calls the service
- Sends back the HTTP response
- Knows nothing about the database

**Service** (`auth.service.ts`)
- Contains all business logic
- Hashing passwords, generating tokens, checking if user exists
- Calls the repository to get/save data
- Knows nothing about HTTP

**Repository** (`auth.repository.ts`)
- Only talks to the database
- `findByEmail`, `create`, `update`, `delete`
- No business logic at all
- Just raw database operations

**Why separate them?**

If tomorrow you want to switch from TypeORM to Prisma, you only change the repository — the service and controller stay untouched.

If tomorrow you want to switch from REST to GraphQL, you only change the controller — the service and repository stay untouched.

Each layer is **independent**, **testable**, and **replaceable**.
